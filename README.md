# Build and Run
Require JDK 11, Kotlin 1.8.0, Compose Multiplatform 1.3.0. Gradle version \> 7.5 should work.

```bash
cd /path/to/deuterium
gradle wrapper
gradlew run
# or
gradlew packageReleaseUberJarForCurrentOS
java -jar ./build/compose/jars/[name].jar
```



# Clarification
This project starts with [Code Viewer](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/examples/codeviewer) as base-code. Code Viewer is an example application provided by the Compose Multiplatform framework. It comes with the code for displaying a file in read-only mode and offers an user interface for file tree and text view. Functionalities other than those are newly implemented.
